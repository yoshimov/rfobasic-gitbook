Comments
========

## ! - Single Line Comment

If the first character in a line is the "!" character, BASIC! considers the entire line a comment and ignores it. If the "!" appears elsewhere in the line it does not indicate a comment.

## Rem - Single Line Comment (legacy)

If the first three characters in a line are "Rem", "REM", or even "rEm", BASIC! considers the entire line a comment and ignores it. If "Rem" appears elsewhere in the line it does not indicate a comment.

## !! - Block Comment

When a line begins with the "!!" characters, all lines that follow are considered comments and are ignored by BASIC! The Block Comment section ends at the next line that starts with "!!"

## % - Middle of Line Comment

If the "%" character appears in a line (except within a quoted string) then rest of the line is a comment.
